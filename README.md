I, @adMartem, am a programmer. Started out a long time ago using the IBM 1620.  Wrote a lot of assembly language OS stuff for the SDS 930, CDC 6600, TI 990 and TI ASC (Advanced Scientific Computer). Morphed into the GM of the Texas branch of Ryan-McFarland Corp. (a computer language vendor in the 70's and 80's), and after a convoluted couple of years I ended up managing a programming group for Hospital Corporation of America (HCA).  Eventually became the COO of a reconstituted Ryan-McFarland (minus Ryan and McFarland) when the IP was purchased by another language company, LPI.  LPI eventually became Liant Software Corporation where I was CEO until it was purchased by Micro Focus.  Since then I have been doing what I truly love - programming (mostly Java these days).
